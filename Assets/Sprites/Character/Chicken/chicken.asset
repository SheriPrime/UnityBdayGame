  - Hi there!
  - "Oh! Oh dear, oh my\u2014 Hello! You seem like a capable sort. Please, I need
    your help!"
  - What's wrong?
  - 'It''s my baby, my little chick! '
  - '*flaps wings anxiously'
  - 'One moment he was playing near the old wishing well, and the next... '
  - voice cracks ...
  - he just vanished! Fell right through some sort of strange portal!
  - A portal? Where did he go?
  - "I managed to peek through before it started closing, and I saw him\u2014he's
    trapped in this bizarre, endless sky!"
  - There are these horrible green pipes everywhere, and he has to keep flapping
    just to stay airborne. shudders It's like some kind of nightmare world where
    gravity works all wrong!
  - That sounds terrifying. How can I help?
  - I... I can't fly well enough to navigate that place. My wings are too old, too
    slow. But if you could somehow guide him
  - "be his eyes, his instincts\u2014help him flap through those dreadful pipes and
    get back to the portal home..."
  - I'll do it. I'll get your chick back safely.
  - ' Oh, bless you! Bless you!'
  - "And listen\u2014once my baby is back in my wings, I'll give you the freshest
    eggs from my nest."
  - I was saving them for something special, and what's more special than this? It's
    your birthday AND you're saving my child!
  - Don't worry. I've got this.
  - nods nervously
  - 'Please... be careful. He''s so small, so fragile. Just... keep him flapping.
    Don''t let him fall. '
  - '*voice shakes '
  - Don't let my baby fall.
