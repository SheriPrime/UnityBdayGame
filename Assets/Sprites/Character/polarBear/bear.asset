  - Hey there!
  - Oh! Hello, hello!.... Wait a minute...
  - '*sniffs the air'
  - Is it just me, or do you smell like birthday-ish?
  - "Haha, yeah\u2014it's actually my birthday today."
  - ' No kidding! Well, happy birthday to you!'
  - You know what? I've got something that might make your day even sweeter. I've
    got some delicious chocolate I've been saving.
  - Chocolate? That sounds amazing!
  - '*rubs belly'
  - Here's the thing though... I'm absolutely starving right now, and I can't think
    straight on an empty stomach.
  - I need to get across the ravine to where all the fish are, but... it's full of
    spikes and those nasty little monsters.
  - You need help getting through?
  - Exactly! I'm big and strong, sure, but I'm not exactly nimble when I'm this hungry.
  - looks at MC hopefully
  - "If you could guide me through that treacherous path\u2014you know, help me dodge
    the spikes, avoid those monsters\u2014I'll share my chocolate with you as a birthday
    gift. Fair trade?"
  - Deal! Let's get you fed.
  - Wonderful! Alright, I'm putting my paws in your hands.
  - Let's do this before I pass out from hunger!
